::: FAKE API :::
We connected the Fake-API to the RSSR so you can see how it actually works.

>>> HOW CAN RUN IT
with 'npm run fake' you can launch it.

>>> HOW CAN USE IT in code
we imported fake api in sever files, so you can assess from 'http://localhost:8000/fake-api' in development and port 3000 for production.


>>> HOW TO REMOVE IT:
step1: remove ~/FakeApi directory.
step2: change API_HOST_IN_CLIENT and API_HOST_IN_SERVER in ~/.env.development and ~/.env.production files to your real API address.
step3: go to ~/server/development and ~/server/production files and remve fake api require (Marked with a symbol).
step4: go to ~/src/setup/api.js and set your real routes. NOTICE: before remove or change this routes please find 'api.[ROUTE-NAME]' like 'api.forgetPassword' and do the necessary work.
