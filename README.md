#### what is SSR?
Server Side Rendering is a popular technique for rendering a normally 
client-side single page app (SPA) on the server and then sending
 a fully rendered page to the client. The client’s JavaScript bundle 
 can then take over and the SPA can operate as normal. One major 
 benefit of using SSR is in having an app that can be crawled 
 for its content even for crawlers that don’t execute JavaScript code. 
 This can help with SEO and with providing meta data to social media channels.


#### What is a Boilerplate?
In programming, the term boilerplate code refers to blocks of code used over and over again.

Let’s assume your development stack consists of several libraries,
 such as React, Babel, Express, Jest, Webpack, etc. When you
  start a new project, you initialize all these libraries 
  and configure them to work with each other.

With every new project that you start, you will be repeating yourself.
 You could also introduce inconsistencies in how these libraries
  are set up in each project. This can cause confusion when you
   switch between projects.

This is where boilerplates come in. A boilerplate is a template that
 you can clone and reuse for every project.
